**Subject: Action Required: Bug Fixes and Security Vulnerabilities in Helios Project**

I need your assistance in resolving several errors and security issues that have been identified across the Helios project. I've attached the full error logs for your reference. Below is a summary of the required fixes.

### Backend Issues

* [cite_start]**`helios/backend/server.py`**: There is an "unknown import symbol" error for "Trainer"[cite: 1]. Please investigate and resolve this import issue.
* **`helios/backend/Dockerfile`**: A security scan has detected that the image contains **3 high-severity vulnerabilities**.
* **`helios/Dockerfile.dev`**: The development Docker image has **1 high-severity vulnerability**.

Please investigate the vulnerabilities in both Dockerfiles and apply the necessary patches, which may involve updating the base images or dependencies.

### Frontend Issues

* [cite_start]**`helios/components/CrossModelAnalytics.tsx` and `helios/components/MetacognitiveDashboard.tsx`**: Both of these files are showing multiple TypeScript errors with the message "No overload matches this call" related to the MUI Grid component[cite: 2, 141]. [cite_start]The errors indicate that a required 'component' property is missing [cite: 3, 144] [cite_start]and that the 'item' property does not exist on the component's type definition[cite: 7, 142]. This seems to be a recurring issue in these files.
* **`helios/components/TrainingProgress.tsx`**: The code contains inline CSS styles. Please refactor this to use an external CSS file or a standardized styling solution as per our project's best practices.

Please address these issues and let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks.
